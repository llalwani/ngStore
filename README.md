# ngStore - A (demo) single page web store implemented with the AngularJS framework

This is an angular app that I wrote to teach myself angular.

The original idea was to make an online order form for my wife. As a Weight Watchers leader,
one of her duties was to sell WW products to her memebers. Some of her meetings were held outside
of a Weight Watchers location (where the products are located). For these members, she had to
take paper orders. It was time consuming and error prone to pick orders from paper.  

# Live Demo

The app starts with a shopping cart filled with random items.

## Working features

You can:

* Add/remove items from your cart.
* Empty your cart
* Check out
** Change Order (returns to order form)
** Complete Order
  
## Bugs / missing features

* When you add an item to an empty cart, it doesn't update the cart until you add the next item. 
* The "Place your order" button on the "Complete Order" page does not work.
* Anchor links do not navigate to the anchor.
* The shopping cart grid will overflow if you add too many items.
